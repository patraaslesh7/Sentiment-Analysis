      "[[\"Only a month or so back I was talking to a friend about how much I hate it when serious movies use time travel to get their characters out of problems. I have no problem with movies like 'Back to the Future' or 'Hot Tub Time Machine' that are both comedy based and use the time machine as a plot for the movie as opposed to a solution for characters problems. When a serious movie uses it though it as lazy as writing as dream sequence in my opinion.At the end of the day though that just underlines the problem with these movies. The heroes are far too powerful. Whatever power they need they simply possess conveniently. Heck, 'Dr Strange' can even see into the future to know exactly what to do to make sure everything turns out alright. If that isn't the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie I don't know what is.I felt like the movie went very much as expected as well. Sure some characters die, however they were pretty much telegraphed to do so long before the movie came out. There also seemed to be a lack of conflict as key moments. A lot of things went far too smoothly for my liking in terms of the plan. Finally, the ending with 'Iron Man' simply pulling the glove off 'Thanos' - what the hell was that? Was that supposed to be clever writing? 'Thanos' just standing there for an eternity doing nothing waiting for someone to stop him?A lot of the jokes failed to land too. This was a surprisingly unfunny movie. In a 3 hour movie I got maybe 3 light chuckles out of the film. Every joke just felt so forced and some of the characters who don't have a comedy background delivered them very poorly. 'Avengers: Endgame' is three hours of my life I would like back.\"], [\"Continuity? 350M budget and no one looking over the continuity? Hair styles, braided beard..unbraided...braided again?

Matching the MCU spider man with the villains of marvel past us just the most ridiculous idea on paper but this next phase of marvel films just pulls it right out of the bag.If you are are a marvel fan and are contemplating seeing it, just go see it.

       " {'text': \"I'll just say this right off the cuff, just so everyone can get an idea where I stand on this film. This is so far my favorite MCU movie taking over the throne from Thor: Ragnarok. I loved almost everything about this movie. And a movie that shows exactly how to deliver on fan service, and not just service to the fans but using it to interweave into the story and overall film. I won't spoil anything, but I'm just going to say, it doesn't matter if your a fan of the Maguire Era, or the Garfield Era, you are going to have a good time. I'm more of a Maguire Era person who grew up loving those movies, yes even three, and I adored this and may even surpass the Maguire movies for me. Jon Watts does a fantastic job meshing all of the elements together, keeping it focused, creating good pace, not causing a convoluted mess like so many films that try to have so many elements meshed. I liked also that they kept the MCU humor to a minimum, which I don't mind the humor, it's just got to be used in the correct movie. This isn't the correct movie to have humor, and did a good job of keeping it minimal. Overall, I had a blast with this movie and deserves every eye that watches it. A true masterclass of a job by everyone involved. 10/10.\",\n",
